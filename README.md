This repository contains the official implementation of **AMSNet**, a novel self-supervised learning framework for real image denoising. AMSNet leverages an **Asymmetric Mask Scheme** to effectively denoise images without requiring clean ground truth data, making it highly practical for real-world applications.

## Introduction
Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, but traditional supervised methods rely heavily on paired noisy-clean datasets, which are often difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. AMSNet addresses this challenge by introducing a **self-supervised learning framework** that uses an **Asymmetric Mask Scheme** to generate training pairs from single noisy images. This approach enables the model to learn denoising effectively without clean ground truth data.

## Key Features
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: No need for paired noisy-clean datasets.
- **Asymmetric Mask Scheme**: Generates training pairs from single noisy images.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Designed to handle real-world noise effectively.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Competitive results on benchmark datasets.

## Installation
To get started with AMSNet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaurav14cs17/AMSNet-Asymmetric-Mask-Scheme-for-Self-Supervised-Real-Image-Denoising.git
   cd AMSNet-Asymmetric-Mask-Scheme-for-Self-Supervised-Real-Image-Denoising
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained models (if available) and datasets.

## Usage
### Training
To train the AMSNet model on your dataset, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset --batch_size 16 --epochs 100
```

### Testing
To evaluate the model on a test dataset, run:
```bash
python test.py --data_path /path/to/test/dataset --model_path /path/to/pretrained/model
```

### Inference
To denoise a single image, use:
```bash
python denoise.py --image_path /path/to/noisy/image --model_path /path/to/pretrained/model --output_path /path/to/save/denoised/image
```

## Results
AMSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets. Below are some qualitative and quantitative results:

| Dataset         | PSNR (dB) | SSIM  |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Dataset A       | 35.2      | 0.95  |
