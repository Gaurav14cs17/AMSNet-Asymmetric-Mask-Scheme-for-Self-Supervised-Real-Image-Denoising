# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition  

This repository provides the implementation of the Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) for image classification, based on the paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03981).  

## Introduction  

Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) revolutionized deep learning by addressing the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for training extremely deep architectures. This work introduced residual connections, enabling models to learn identity mappings, which significantly improved convergence and accuracy. ResNets have since become a foundational model in computer vision, powering tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.  

## Model Architecture  

The ResNet architecture consists of stacked residual blocks, which leverage identity shortcuts to enable efficient training of deep networks. The key components of the model are:  

- **Residual Blocks**: Allowing identity mapping to ease optimization.  
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizing training and improving generalization.  
- **Deep Architectures**: Including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152.
