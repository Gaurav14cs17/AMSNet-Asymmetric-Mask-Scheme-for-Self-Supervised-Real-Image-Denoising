# AMSNet Models  

[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-Link-blue)](https://github.com/Gaurav14cs17/AMSNet-Asymmetric-Mask-Scheme-for-Self-Supervised-Real-Image-Denoising)  

This directory contains implementations of various **denoising models** used in the **AMSNet** framework. Each model follows a structured design to facilitate training, evaluation, and comparison with AMSNet.  

## Available Models  

The following denoising models are included in this repository:  

- **MultiMaskPdDN**  
- **APBSN**  
- **BNNLNN**  
- **CVF-SID**  
- **DeamNet**  
- **DNCNN**  
- **FeatureMask**  
- **MIR**  
- **NAFNet**  
- **NAFNetBase**  
- **NBNet**  
- **Restormer**  
- **ScaoedNet**  
- **SimpleDn**  
- **Unet**  

Each model is implemented in a modular way, allowing easy integration into AMSNet and independent testing.
